 ATL_cannibal_island_title: "Cannibal Island"

 ATL_new_world_title: "A New World?"
 ATL_new_world_desc: "It's been long since the inhabitants of the Trident have gone beyond the Nautean islands in search for more land, quite in contrast with our ancestors, who braved the Atlantic to arrive here.

 ATL_second_exile_title: "The Second Exile"
 ATL_second_exile_desc: "A trend to migrate to the newly-discovered lands to the West seems to be inevitable. Many call it the second wave of exiles. Perhaps it's best that we ensure that these settlers are cooperating properly and loyal to us."

 ATL_strengthen_the_army_title: "Strengthen the Army"
 ATL_strengthen_the_army_desc: "Storms, literally and figuratively, approach the Trident Gulf. As the Imperator's health worsens, Atlantis comes closer and closer to all-out civil war.

 ATL_march_to_crownlands_title: "March to the Crownlands"
 ATL_march_to_crownlands_desc: "The Crownlands are a shadow of their former selves, but are still wealthy and densely populated, on top of their obvious symbolic importance. If we seek to conquer the whole continent, the Crownlands are a good next step."
 
 ATL_the_new_empire_title: "The New Empire"
 ATL_the_new_empire_desc: "All other lords in Atlantis are merely pretender warlords, seeking to grow their fragile positions within the continent.

 ATL_prepare_imperial_army_title: "Prepare Imperial Army"

 ATL_pathway_to_europe_title: "Pathway to Europe"
 ATL_pathway_to_europe_desc: "The Macaronesian Archipelago, originally settled by Iberians, is a key point in the Atlantic Ocean. It's close to the coast of Africa enough to threaten the Berbers, and using the coast, it's easy to reach Europe. For us, living in a largely seaborne society, they serve as an interesting strategic location."

 ANX_victors_payoff_title: "Victor's Payoff"

 ANX_african_security_title: "African Security"

 ANX_fell_the_nahua_desc: "The Nahua peoples of Mexico are quite... gross. Their rituals including sacrifice, both human and animal, and their rulers violently harass their rival states by demanding tributes in lives.

 ANX_mare_clausum_title: "Mare Clausum"
 ANX_mare_clausum_desc: "Our foreign influence is growing by the day. Should we maintain our dominance in our seas, we will be able to close it down and institute a policy of Mare Clausum. No foreigners will be able to go through our seas without showing some respect and paying some tolls."

 ANX_atlantean_intervention_desc: "Atlanteans have always been generally wealthier than Antillians, due to our island being less populated, harder to traverse, and messier to navigate.

 ANX_antillian_atlantis_title: "Antillian Atlantis"

 ANX_imperii_antillium_title: "Imperii Antillium"
 ANX_imperii_antillium_desc: "The Atlantean crisis over emperorship is drawing to a close, as it seems their unifier is not going to be some local warlord, but rather, us mighty Antillians.
