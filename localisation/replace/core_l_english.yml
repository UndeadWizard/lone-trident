 KARMA_DESC2:0 "Karma represents the divinity of your past actions in the eyes of the Luu Xin faith and will rise or fall depending on the morality of actions you take. A ruler with too extreme Karma will become detached from the world. Too high Karma means losing the trust of the common soldier while too low Karma will make you ineffective on the diplomatic arena. Countries with Karma do not pay any diplomatic power cost for returning cores and releasing countries and vassals in peace deals."
