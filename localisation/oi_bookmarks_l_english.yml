 BOOKMARK_OI_ATLANTIS_BOOKMARK: "Atlantis: The Shattered Trident"
 BOOKMARK_OI_ATLANTIS_BOOKMARK_DESC: "It has been nearly a century since the collapse of the Atlantean Empire. The plagues and famines that had wracked Atlantis for so long have subsided, and the scars have begun to heal, yet the old lords remain merely in the vicinity of the old capital of Atla. As the old recedes, multiple new states have risen with the ambition to further themselves, or perhaps even claim the legacy of old. Further South, in Antillia, the many states of the island seek a permanent solution to their internal squabbles."
