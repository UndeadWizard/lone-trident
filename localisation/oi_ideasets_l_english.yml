 #Atlantean Generic
 atlantis_group_ideas: "Atlantean Minor Ideas"
 atlantis_group_ideas_start: "Atlantean Minor Traditions"
 atlantis_group_ideas_bonus: "Atlantean Minor Ambition"
 atla_gen_1: "A Forced Diversity"
 atla_gen_1_desc: "Our ancestors come from several tribes from the East that landed and settled in Atlantean land. At first, they were divided and fought over simple matters of faith or land, but through blood and iron they were conquered under Emperor Akakio. However, they weren't truly united until the differences between them simply became what made Atlanteans who they are. The scar still remains from those turbulent times, but so does a valuable lesson in tolerance."
 atla_gen_2: "Romani"
 atla_gen_2_desc: "The highest honor bestowed upon the Atlantean soldiers is the title of '"Romani', though in recent years its prestige has diminished due to how quickly its holders have perished during the division of Atlantis. However, as the Trident heals from the famines and plagues of the bygone era of the Collapse we have seen an uptick of warriors training to earn the right to be called Romani."
 atla_gen_3: "Rites of April"
 atla_gen_3_desc: "For all in Atlantis, April is an important month. The Rites of April take almost half of the month, and festivities of all sorts are launched, with many celebrations for weeks on end. Even those who do not follow our religion, at this point, are culturally inclined to participare in the parties. Needless to say, this much celebration for this long a period means the rites are usually accompanied by multiple orgies."
 atla_gen_4: "Lessons of Phoenicia"
 atla_gen_4_desc: "Though our Romani ancestors make the cornerstone of Atlantean culture in the west, the Poenici and Ayadoni to the East hold strong to many maritime rituals from the ancient Graeca and Phoinike tribes. Comparatively, many sailors from the Poenici and Ayadoni lands fare better in the oceans than those from the west. The standardization of the eastern rituals on our entire navy would surely lead to improvement." 
 atla_gen_5: "Riches of the Trident"
 atla_gen_5_desc: "Atlantis is isolated from any other large landmasses, as the nearby sattlelite islands are too small. Atlantis is the queen of productivity in our vicinity, and our goods, common or exotic, are certain to attract many buyers."
 atla_gen_6: "Break the economic isolation"
 atla_gen_6_desc: "More peoples from the East have been making contact, from a land called Europa. We know not what their intentions are, but it seems they've made their wealth from trading far and out for the best goods all around the ocean. We could stand to learn from this. If anything, let's open up to their merchants."
 atla_gen_7: "Navy modernization"
 atla_gen_7_desc: "The European presence is making it increasingly clear that our navy is outdated and in need of a reform to keep up with the times. We never know when we'll need to defend ourselves, or perhaps project our influence outwards..."
 
 #Atlantean Islander
 atlantis_islander_ideas: "Atlantean Islander Ideas"
 atlantis_islander_ideas_start: "Atlantean Islander Traditions"
 atlantis_islander_ideas_bonus: "Atlantean Islander Ambition"
 atlantis_islander_1: "Control Atlantean Shores"
 atlantis_islander_1_desc: "When your entire existence is in an island, you know fully well that envelopment and blockade are disastrous. Not as much for land lovers, but we've learned enough to know how to optimize our spread and make sure they suffer."
 atlantis_islander_2: "Coast to Coast Tactics"
 atlantis_islander_2_desc: "Fighting in the coasts has taught our people to rely more on long-ranged attacks, like bows and crossbows, rather than sword and spear. It does help that the future is looking bright for ranged warfare."
 atlantis_islander_3: "Islander Brain Gain"
 atlantis_islander_3_desc: "The islands contain some fairly large towns, and while they are not the greatest in Atlantis, they are large enough to support the commerce involved with being central. All of this is a major boon, as our migrant attraction is akin to those or the larger cities."
 atlantis_islander_4: "Connected Network"
 atlantis_islander_4_desc: "Our center location also brings not quite tangible benefits, notably that all of Atlantis is within our reach for negotiations, and we have some leverage in it."
 atlantis_islander_5: "Domination by Barrage"
 atlantis_islander_5_desc: "From our safe haven - the sea - we are able to dish out pain to those in land. And there isn't much they can do if they fail to contest our naval supremacy."
 atlantis_islander_6: "Mingle with Europeans"
 atlantis_islander_6_desc: "Our privileged position has made us stand out for European visitors. We can make use of their knowledge."
 atlantis_islander_7: "Trident States"
 atlantis_islander_7_desc: "The Trident Islands are home to states that have known nothing but interconnectivity through their navies, war or mechant. We're the prime example of sailor peoples."
 
 #Nautean Generic
 nautean_group_ideas: "Nautean Ideas"
 nautean_group_ideas_start: "Nautean Traditions"
 nautean_group_ideas_bonus: "Nautean Ambition"
 naut_gen_1: "Innovations from Atlantis"
 naut_gen_1_desc: "We might not like to admit it, but Atlantis usually knows how to handle advancements better than we do. We have to adapt, learning from them so that we might thrive as much as they once did."
 naut_gen_2: "A Sailing People"
 naut_gen_2_desc: "Our tradition of sailing has gotten us farther than any Atlantean ever did. Let's not disappoint our ancestors and proceed with our seabound feats."
 naut_gen_3: "Rites of April"
 naut_gen_3_desc: "For all in Atlantis, April is an important month. The Rites of April take almost half of the month, and festivities of all sorts are launched, with many celebrations for weeks on end. Even those who do not follow our religion, at this point, are culturally inclined to participare in the parties. Needless to say, this much celebration for this long a period means the rites are usually accompanied by multiple orgies."
 naut_gen_4: "Defend our Autonomy!"
 naut_gen_4_desc: "Atlantis once influenced our islands to the point we had no control over our own fates. This has changed with time. We cannot let that happen ever again!"
 naut_gen_5: "Islands of cheap labor"
 naut_gen_5_desc: "Many of our inhabitants descend from slaves to some extent. For Atlanteans, us Nauteans have always been the cheap labor. At first, this might seem sad, but it shows our people's heart is grander, accepting the same tasks for lesser pay. More importantly, it makes it easier to pay the footmen!"
 naut_gen_6: "Break the economic isolation"
 naut_gen_6_desc: "More peoples from the East have been making contact, from a land called Europa. We know not what their intentions are, but it seems they've made their wealth from trading far and out for the best goods all around the ocean. We could stand to learn from this. If anything, let's open up to their merchants."
 naut_gen_7: "From the beach to the hills"
 naut_gen_7_desc: "Our archipelago's long beaches break into fairly sizeable hills as they go further inland. It might be hard to protect our direct coast, but we won't let that mean our end. We'll retreat to the hills if need be."
 
 #Meropis, the Atlantean equivalent of a potential terrorist
 meropis_ideas: "Meropian Ideas"
 meropis_ideas_start: "Meropian Traditions"
 meropis_ideas_bonus: "Meropian Ambition"
 meropis_1: "Ram into them if you have to!"
 meropis_1_desc: "We absolutely refuse the very idea of defeat against foreign navies, specially Atlantean ones. Our port authorities have been ordered to stab anyone who leaves a ship alive after a naval defeat. Our admirals and sailors will have to fight to the last, else they'll die when they dock anyway."
 meropis_2: "The soldiers of Machimos"
 meropis_2_desc: "Machimos is a highly belligerent town within our island. They're the epitome of soldier loyalty, and they'll certainly be of help in our wars."
 meropis_3: "Brains of Eusebes"
 meropis_3_desc: "If Machimos is known for the brawns, Eusebes is known for the brains. Skilled scholars reside there to fill in our pool of smarts."
 meropis_4: "Destroy the April Rites"
 meropis_4_desc: "We hate the month of April. Atlantis' love for their annual rites in that season makes it a disgusting, degenerate month full of the most despicable acts being done in that wretched hole of an island. It's our duty to ourselves to completely eradicate it by invading Atlantis and cracking down on them. Permanently."
 meropis_5: "Set Atlantis Alight"
 meropis_5_desc: "Why stop at the rites, anyway? All of Atlantis must burn, and that's non-negotiable."
 meropis_6: "From the Ashes of the Degenerates"
 meropis_6_desc: "As we burn down the states of the immoral island of Atlantis, we shall take the skeleton of that disgusting existence and turn it into a pillar for our own society to thrive. We will build an empire, far better than theirs! Not that it's much, anyway."
 meropis_7: "Enslave all survivors!"
 meropis_7_desc: "And any Atlanteans we find alive after we're done are going straight to work camps to bolster our economy!"
 
 #Antillia
 antillian_ideas: "Antillian Minor Ideas"
 antillian_ideas_start: "Antillian Minor Traditions"
 antillian_ideas_bonus: "Antillian Minor Ambition"
 antillian_1: "Theocratic Rule"
 antillian_1_desc: "Antillia has a history of clerical domination ever since it's establishment. It has worked very well thus far, and will remain so for the rest of our history."
 antillian_2: "Centralized Navy"
 antillian_2_desc: "Antillia was only reachable because of our shipbuilding, we cannot abandon this important piece of knowledge in the past."
 antillian_3: "Visigothic Roots"
 antillian_3_desc: "We have originated from the Visigoths that once controlled Hispania through sheer military might. We weren't the brighest statebuilders, but we definetely were - and still are - good fighters."
 antillian_4: "The Heptarchic faith"
 antillian_4_desc: "We have braved the terrain of Antillia because we could trust in the Lord. Other Christians tended to scorn us, but we're as faithful as they are!"
 antillian_5: "The feats of Jesus"
 antillian_5_desc: "The great feats of Jesus Christ, from the calmer ones such as walking on water to the more epic ones such as overcoming the mighty three-headed hellhound Cerberus, have been described in our holy books. Those epic works of literature serve as a reminder of how to be good Christians."
 antillian_6: "Collect more Tithes"
 antillian_6_desc: "Our treasuries are not to run dry as easily as others so long as our faithful population continues to provide us healthy tithes."
 antillian_7: "Holy Mandates"
 antillian_7_desc: "Our rulerships have been mandated by none other than God himself. None can argue against the word of Heaven."
 
 #Thule
 thuler_ideas: "Thuler Ideas"
 thuler_ideas_start: "Thuler Traditions"
 thuler_ideas_bonus: "Thuler Ambition"
 thuler_1: "Legacy of Norse incursions"
 thuler_1_desc: "In early Thuler history, Norse raiders came to the island to attempt to raid and take over. They succeeded in Iceland, but they didn't in here. The Norse raiders have since stopped, but we've learned the hard way to always have some garrisons prepared."
 thuler_2: "Resilience of the Irish"
 thuler_2_desc: "The people of Ireland are known for being resilient to foreigners. We're not quite in Ireland anymore, but we're their descendants, and we intend on keeping such trait."
 thuler_3: "Papar Legacy"
 thuler_3_desc: "Our state is a legacy of the Papar excusions northwards, proud Catholics willing to risk everything for the sake of spreading the words of Jesus Christ."
 thuler_4: "Invite Mainland Irishmen"
 thuler_4_desc: "Being a sparsely populated region, Thule is always in need of more people. We can bank on attracting Irish immigrants, our brethren will sure have some people to send to us."
 thuler_5: "Unfaltering against the odds"
 thuler_5_desc: "We Papars have faced all sorts of crappy weather in Ireland, to find even worse ones in our travels, and then land on an island about as bad as our own. Needless to say, we've learned the hard way to never falter against anything."
 thuler_6: "In depth coastal defense"
 thuler_6_desc: "Thule, fortunately, is a blessed island when it comes to defense. The coasts are particularly easy to maneuver around in. We are to make full use of this."
 thuler_7: "Northern Evangelizers"
 thuler_7_desc: "Papars have been out and about in the North Sea for centuries, seeking for new places to spread our faith. We've seemingly ran out around here, but we're always willing to go some ways further to do more proselytizing."
 
 #Trichotos
 trichotos_ideas: "Trichotan Ideas"
 trichotos_ideas_start: "Trichotan Traditions"
 trichotos_ideas_bonus: "Trichotan Ambition"
 trichotos_1: "The New Roman Exiles"
 trichotos_1_desc: "Many in Atlantis can trace their lineage to some Roman soldier, from the lost legion. Yet we are different; our leadership comes from an Italiot noble loyal to the Eastern Romans, after a series of borderline ironic mishaps at sea leading them far away from their home in the Catepanate of Italy. We've got more stories to tell about Europe prior to our departure, and are generally looked towards when seeking information about it."
 trichotos_2: "Cataphracts in Atlantis"
 trichotos_2_desc: "It's not common for Atlanteans to adapt cavalry tactics for various reasons, but our rulers' ascendancy was very fond of the Cataphracts of old. Lethal in combat back in Europe, they are a fearsome force in Atlantis, as all fear the mighty horsemen of Trichotos."
 trichotos_3: "Atlantean Crossbowmen"
 trichotos_3_desc: "Another foreign invention we are fond of is the crossbow. Those small weapons fire arrows more accurately than bows do, and are much easier to use, not requiring years of training to be a decent shot with. Truly an equalizer on the field."
 trichotos_4: "Italiot Nobles"
 trichotos_4_desc: "The amount of women willing to put themselves as courtiers for us is far greater than usual for Atlantean courts. It seems they dig the Italian ones."
 trichotos_5: "Thematic Navies"
 trichotos_5_desc: "We prefer to screen our admirals from local talents from our provinces rather than nominate whoever shows up in our door with a large enough bucket of gold or someone vaguely related to nobility seeking a way to get recognition."
 trichotos_6: "Advanced War Logistics"
 trichotos_6_desc: "Our first kings survived what was probably the longest voyage of our times, one worthy to be called a Third Odyssey by all means. Needless to say, the family is particularly skilled at logistics."
 trichotos_7: "Eastern Roman Bureaucracy"
 trichotos_7_desc: "Adopting administrative decisions from our old masters in Constantinople and expanding our bureaucracy is sure to expand our capacity to properly rule our subjects."
 
 #Tadipouro
 tadipouro_ideas: "Tadipouran Ideas"
 tadipouro_ideas_start: "Tadipouran Traditions"
 tadipouro_ideas_bonus: "Tadipouran Ambition"
 tadipouro_1: "Gauntlet Footmen"
 tadipouro_1_desc: "It's not too uncommon that Tadipouran soldiers use gauntlets for their primary weaponries. It might not be the most efficient, but it sure teaches them to value their every move, and shows our enemies how fierce we are when we win."
 tadipouro_2: "Statesmen"
 tadipouro_2_desc: "A state cannot be ran solely on the idea of a fierce army. Diplomacy is necessary if we seek to keep ourselves ahead of our rivals."
 tadipouro_3: "Black Order"
 tadipouro_3_desc: "Tadipouro is home to the Black Order, a large group of mercenaries that acted in wars around most of Atlantis. With some pruning, they might just become regular members of our army."
 tadipouro_4: "Large Warships"
 tadipouro_4_desc: "Comparatively to our neighbors, we don't quite have a tradition of good seamanship, but we retain many of their shipbuilding techniques. Being Atlanteans, after all, it's almost a given. We'll make sure our boats are larger and bulkier so our sailors feel safer."
 tadipouro_5: "Dedicated Frontiersmen"
 tadipouro_5_desc: "Tadipouran frontiers are filled with unnoficial patrols led by dismissed or inactive soldiers, trying to keep out our nosy neighbors, so they can't steal our vast riches. They sometimes come to us with a foreigner, tied and forced into submission. We're not sure how to handle these patrols, but we could certainly invite their unofficial leaders to our army."
 tadipouro_6: "Gemstones!"
 tadipouro_6_desc: "All these truly outrageous gems on top of crowns used by Atlantean lords ultimately trace back to the caves in the mountains North of us. The only major mine of the continent is in our hands!"
 tadipouro_7: "Practices for Standardization"
 tadipouro_7_desc: "Ultimately, our armies are an organizational mess. The regulars, the Black Army, the patrols and whatnot all act separately, with little cohesion. This has worked previously, but it can't work forever. We need to enforce coordination amongst them."
 
 #Hermusa
 hermusa_ideas: "Hermusan Ideas"
 hermusa_ideas_start: "Hermusan Traditions"
 hermusa_ideas_bonus: "Hermusan Ambition"
 hermusa_1: "Mercenary Reliance"
 hermusa_1_desc: "Our population is fairly small due to our lack of a countryside. As a result, we tend to include large numbers of mercenaries in our ranks. Experience has given us hints on how to negotiate with them."
 hermusa_2: "Northern Bastion"
 hermusa_2_desc: "Hermusa has been described as one of the most well-defended cities of Atlantis. Being in the opean sea makes it harder to maintain a blockade and our forts have been grand in scale from their conception."
 hermusa_3: "Planned Financial Expansion"
 hermusa_3_desc: "The city limits have been expanded largely plannedly rather than chaotically by private effort. This is due to our attempts to centralize the economic growth, so that we can see to it that time isn't our cities' greatest enemy."
 hermusa_4: "Developmental Theories"
 hermusa_4_desc: "Our planned expansion has given us plenty experience on how to handle the spread of development, to the point we've been formulating theories on it's optimization long before any other country even had planned city-building."
 hermusa_5: "Innovators by Heart"
 hermusa_5_desc: "All around Atlantis, those from Turan are known for their intuitive skill and imagination. As the others say, we are innovators by heart, not the kind that is disencouraged by failure."
 hermusa_6: "Centralization of Trade"
 hermusa_6_desc: "Wealth in the Northern coast of Atlantis largely moves through land rather than sea, due to the dangers of the open sea. Combine this factor with the planned expansion and we've effectively control the passage of goods around the North; our docks are the only ones that are good enough to keep large ships safe. This is our own little source of extra revenue."
 hermusa_7: "Legacy of Hermusan Autonomy"
 hermusa_7_desc: "Our little corner of the world has enjoyed special autonomy even back when we were under central rule from Atla. This will never change, for if the tides threaten to move that way, we'll fight to the last."
 
 #Tauryria

 tauryria_ideas_start: "Tauryrian Traditions"
 tauryria_ideas_bonus: "Tauryrian Ambition"
 tauryria_1: "Boarding Tactics"
 tauryria_1_desc: "Our main offensive strategy at sea is to get close and mass board enemy ships. Our hardy seamen makes this tactic tried and true."
 tauryria_2: "Maintenance Canoes"
 tauryria_2_desc: "Using smaller boats to support the construction and maintenance of bigger ones will ensure our dock workers will be able to find out hull failures more easily and fix them."
 tauryria_3: "Keeping up with Naval Advancements"
 tauryria_3_desc: "The Nautean Islands - and all of Atlantis, for that matter - sees influence be concentrated on those nations who can project themselves at the sea. We can't let ourselves have outdated boats."
 tauryria_4: "Talk Like a Pirate Day"
 tauryria_4_desc: "We had the greatest idea of sending agents into Atlantis decades ago and start joking about talking like a pirate on a specific day, every year. And by a pirate, we mean speaking in a Nautean accent. This great feat of propaganda has gone completely unnoticed by other states as the Tauryrian speech starts to become charming in the whole continent's eyes!"
 tauryria_5: "Western Slave-Raids"
 tauryria_5_desc: "We're to blame everytime someone asks why Nauteans have so many native traits. After all, we're the main slave drivers around!"
 tauryria_6: "Applying Boarding Experience"
 tauryria_6_desc: "Our experience on boarding often means we start having close-quarters infantry fights with other crewsmen. Slowly, our navy has been budding some skilled infantrymen. Applying them in land combat is tough, but at least we have a recruiting pool now."
 tauryria_7: "Pirate Freedom"
 tauryria_7_desc: "Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free!"

 cannibal_1: "Easy Supply Access"
 cannibal_1_desc: "It's hard to starve our people out when every dead soldier is actively contributing to our non-starvation."
 cannibal_2: "Scare Tactics"
 cannibal_2_desc: "Our enemies should have a solid idea of what their fate is should they fight us and lose. And damn, they're wholly correct."
 cannibal_3: "Special Siege Logistics"
 cannibal_3_desc: "So long as there are people in the cities we are defending, we are sure we won't suffer from starvation. This conviction shall carry ourselves to victory in sieges!"
 cannibal_4: "The Fate of the Rebels"
 cannibal_4_desc: "Is to fall prey to our armies!"
 cannibal_5: "Nourished Builders"
 cannibal_5_desc: "Working on an empty stomach is a terrifying thought, we can ensure our people are at their best by keeping them fed at all times. Our working builders are no exception."
 cannibal_6: "Army Food Safety"
 cannibal_6_desc: "The easiest way to fill your plate in the Anthropofagoi territory is to join our army, so long as there is war, it'll see plenty food."
 cannibal_7: "The Way of Khronos"
 cannibal_7_desc: "Our patron deity is more than just a patron, but a role model. Khronos' great deeds are heavily inspiring for us, and we seek to ensure that in our daily lives, we follow his footsteps."

 ansalli_ideas: "Ansalli Ideas"
 ansalli_ideas_start: "Ansalli Traditions"
 ansalli_ideas_bonus: "Ansalli Ambition"
 ansalli_1: "The Enlightened Corps"
 ansalli_1_desc: "A militaristic faction serving the Supreme Archbishop of Ansalli. While there are questions about their loyalties, they certainly are a fearsome force."
 ansalli_2: "Institute of War"
 ansalli_2_desc: "Ansalli has learned to homebrew it's own great leaders by founding a school focused on teaching warfare to our prospecting generals."
 ansalli_3: "Case Studies"
 ansalli_3_desc: "It's part of the curriculum in the Institute to check for case studies on how leadership is to be carried out, thus making sure our alumni either learn from others' mistakes, or are inspired by their successes."
 ansalli_4: "Skilled Metallurgy"
 ansalli_4_desc: "We still have much in common with the visigoths of old, including our advanced metallurgical skills."
 ansalli_5: "Courses on Firearms"
 ansalli_5_desc: "Firearms are being seen more and more often on battlefields worldwide, and Antillia might follow suit. To keep our high standards, we must inform or generals how to handle them and how to face them."
 ansalli_6: "Supreme Archbishopric of Ansalli"
 ansalli_6_desc: "Our leaders are titled Supreme Archbishops, not merely Bishops or Archbishops. We're above the rest of the theocracies of the world at large. As such, we cannot forfeit our duty to the Lord."
 ansalli_7: "Avoid Naval Neglect"
 ansalli_7_desc: "Our safety in Antillia's politics is due to our strong land force, for the singular island is easy to control by land. Yet, to project further, or simply defend ourselves, we will also need to keep our naval standards high."
 
 #Artzainoi
 artzainoi_ideas: "Artzainoi Ideas"
 artzainoi_ideas_start: "Artzainoi Traditions"
 artzainoi_ideas_bonus: "Artzainoi Ambition"
 artzainoi_1: "Salarium"
 artzainoi_1_desc: "We produce a vast amount of salt in our lands. It's a valuable resource for many as it helps give taste to food as well as conserve it."
 artzainoi_2: "Anti-Smuggler Audits"
 artzainoi_2_desc: "A lot of the salt we produce ends up getting smuggled out of our lands, giving us no revenue for our trouble of mining it. No more, we'll make it a priority to audit goods going out."
 artzainoi_3: "Deck Food Conservation"
 artzainoi_3_desc: "The plentiful salt from our coast allows us to conserve a lot of food on deck, thus enabling our ships to go farther than most Atlanteans could ever dare to go."
 artzainoi_4: "Atlantean Rediscoveries"
 artzainoi_4_desc: "Our outwards exploration has had us arrive in foreign lands, and discovered several interesting states such as Portugal. We have a chance to be Atlantis' gate into European history and learn more about our past than."
 artzainoi_5: "Venturing out of the Trident"
 artzainoi_5_desc: "Now that we are aware there is plenty of empty space worldwide for us to send our people to, it's our duty to start processes of expanding outside of our continent."
 artzainoi_6: "Western Drill Sargeants"
 artzainoi_6_desc: "After making contact with the Europeans, we have learned that they advanced further in warfare than we did. We could use some of their teachings to improve our own."
 artzainoi_7: "Early Firearm Trauma"
 artzainoi_7_desc: "We couldn't help but be shocked at how Europe handles its wars. Long ranged weapons that look like large sticks, but can kill a man in a single shot, pierce through most armor, and is hard to even spot the projectile. We'll start planning for encountering foes using such technologies."
 
 #Zephyria
 zephyria_ideas: "Zephyrian Ideas"
 zephyria_ideas_start: "Zephyrian Traditions"
 zephyria_ideas_bonus: "Zephyrian Ambition"
 zephyria_1: "Great Eastern Founders"
 zephyria_1_desc: "Having first appeared in history lording over Mysias, Ayadon's political center, as well as Vescleves, its commercial center, the rulers of Zephyria have been responsible for the foundation of several other major cities. Notably, some of these cities would later become the foremost cities within their domain - Zephyropolis and Nea Mysias."
 zephyria_2: "The Forced Marches"
 zephyria_2_desc: "When central authority collapsed, the Ayadoni region, previously held back by the centralization of the government, turned into a region of warlords much larger in size than those in the western half of Atlantis. Zephyria in particular suffered from being right inbetween three regional powerhouses - Tadipouro, Trichotos and Sorginak. To counteract that, the armies often had to march from border to border with little to no rest."
 zephyria_3: "Mysian Triangle"
 zephyria_3_desc: "Fertile and blessed with many resources, gold included, the Mysian Triangle is a notoriously wealthy part of Atlantis in terms of raw materials."
 zephyria_4: "The Zephyrian Dynasty"
 zephyria_4_desc: "One of the first High Atlantean dynasties to be given control over provinces in the Ayadoni region, the Zephyrians adapted quickly to the local situation, navigating its divergent and incomplete, yet impressively dynamic, economy."
 zephyria_5: "Doctrine of Forceful Offense"
 zephyria_5_desc: "It was famously said by Rex Nikolaos that Zephyrian leaders could never afford to use fallback lines or guerillas. Due to a lack of natural barriers, victory in the region was highly dependant on swift, aggressive movement into enemy territory, then exploitation of momentum - or, at the very least, reaching a defensive line within enemy territory."
 zephyria_6: "Adoption of Gunpowder"
 zephyria_6_desc: "Outwards expansion left the Zephyrian state with a coast on the Atlantic Ocean, from whence they were one of the first states to receive European visits. Firearms and its respective adoption have been a priority ever since these visitors struck a safe victory when outnumbered against an Artzainoi expedition into their insular possessions. We can't lag behind."
 zephyria_7: "Rex Ayadonis"
 zephyria_7_desc: "Imperial Atlantean instability and decentralization allowed the formation of parallel powers, and, in Ayadon, we were the powerhouse. Our ascension marks a new era for the politics of Atlantis, and we have since greatly expanded our bureaucracy to match."

 antillian_republic_1: "Citizenship by Conversion"
 antillian_republic_1_desc: "Several rights are denied to those who do not publically practice the Heptarchic faith. Nasty as it is, it functions as a coercive force."
 antillian_republic_2: "Mixed Navy"
 antillian_republic_2_desc: "Our state is blessed with a navy larger than usual, but this is due to a high amount of merchant ships. They're less fit, but still sufficiently good at fighting; we'll embrace that."
 antillian_republic_3: "Visigothic Roots"
 antillian_republic_3_desc: "We have originated from the Visigoths that once controlled Hispania through sheer military might. We weren't the brighest statebuilders, but we definetely were - and still are - good fighters."
 antillian_republic_4: "Popularity Proselytism"
